          <h2>Fitness</h2>
          <p>
            Health and fitness are directly proportional to food. The good food
            you have the healthier you will be. We should have a balanced diet. It
            should contain nutrients as per your needs. If you work in an office
            where you have a lot of brainwork, then you should prefer protein-rich
            food; whereas if you have to apply muscular force then you should go
            for carbohydrates. It does not mean to have only proteins and carbs.
            Your food should contain more amounts of these materials.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Being healthy and fit are two different terms but are interlinked to
            each other. Health is a state of body where your body, as well as the
            brain, are in a good state. Staying fit is something that reflects
            your body's stamina and strength.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We see many old people but they look active and fit. Staying fit is
            something you need to maintain. We should go for regular exercise and
            have a good diet. Having food fulfills your daily need and doing
            physical activities makes you active and fit.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We should prefer doing yoga because it maintains our health as well as
            gives us mental peace. We should always have a “Me Time”. Eat healthy
            food and follow some healthy daily routine and stay fit and healthy
            forever.

              Exercise controls weight: Exercise can help prevent excess weight
              gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical
              activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more
              calories you burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't
              worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day.
              Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the
              benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day —
              take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household
              chores. Consistency is key.

              Exercise combats health conditions and diseases Worried about heart
              disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your
              current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein
              (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases
              unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing
              smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
              Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and
              concerns, including: Stroke Metabolic syndrome High blood pressure
              Type 2 diabetes Depression Anxiety Many types of cancer Arthritis
              Falls It can also help improve cognitive function and helps lower
              the risk of death from all causes.

              Exercise improves mood Need an emotional lift? Or need to destress
              after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help.
              Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave
              you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. You may also
              feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise
              regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your

              Exercise boosts energy Winded by grocery shopping or household
              chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength
              and boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to
              your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more
              efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have
              more energy to tackle daily chores.

              Exercise can be fun … and social! Exercise and physical activity can
              be enjoyable. They give you a chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors
              or simply engage in activities that make you happy. Physical
              activity can also help you connect with family or friends in a fun
              social setting. So take a dance class, hit the hiking trails or join
              a soccer team. Find a physical activity you enjoy, and just do it.
